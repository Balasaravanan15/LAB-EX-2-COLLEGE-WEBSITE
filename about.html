    <p> Saranathan College of Engineering was founded by “Vidya Seva Ratnam”, “Guru Seva Mani” Auditor Sri. K. Santhanam in the year 1998. It was so named in respectful memory of his Guru Principal Saranathan, the greatest ever Principal of National College. It is a self financing college approved by AICTE and affiliated to Anna University, Chennai.

        The college was temporarily (approx. 2 years) located in the Seshasayee Institute of Technology, thanks to the gracious permission from the Honorary Secretary and Correspondent of that Institution, Er. G. Sundaram and shifted to its current sprawling 40 acre campus on the Chennai – Madurai Expressway at Panjappur on 3rd January 2000 and was formally inaugurated on 19th October 2000, by “Peraasiriyar K Anbazhagan, the then Minister of Education, Government of Tamil Nadu.
        
        The college has a current annual intake of 660 students for the 7 branches offered at the undergraduate level and 132 students for the 5 courses offered at the post-graduate level.</p>
        
        <p>With a built up area of 200000 sq ft, 8 seminar halls and a state of the art library with more than 55688 books and 225 periodicals and journals (both national and international), the college offers the ideal environment for the students to absorb and assimilate the top class technical education and professional training offered.
        
        The college has a well equipped Computer Centre and has installed internet with 76 Mbps connectivity. The entire college is networked with unique log-in IDs and passwords for each student. The Computer Centre takes great pride in the fact that they have installed and run a dedicated “cloud centre”.
        
        The Faculty with an outstanding academic background and sound conceptual knowledge of contemporary engineering studies and practices ably complete the process of converting the budding students into employable technocrats. Thus the faculty is research oriented is evident from the fact that quite a few of them already hold Ph.D degrees and many more are pursuing their Ph.D studies. Thus the University recognizes such talent is obvious when the university bestows the college is a “nodal centre” of the university for their on-going Quality Improvement Circle (QIC). In addition, a few of our faculty members are also a part of the Board of Studies and contribute to the framing of syllabi for the various courses that they have specialized in. They also serve the role of reviewers in reputed journals by show-casing their academic acceptability in the peer community of eminent educationists. That this whole process is completed keeping in mind the College Vision, Mission and Quality policy is an achievement that the Faculty takes pride in.
        
        One method of an objective measurement of the quality of education imparted at the college would be the number of rank holders at the examinations held at the University level. We had 13 students within the top 50 rank holders at the Final University examination held in 2009, 20 in the year 2010 and leaped to 57 for the 2011 examinations. This academic excellence reached new heights with 88 students placed within the top 50 ranks in the year 2012 ( including three (3) 1st rankers and two (2) second rankers) and 67 students in the year 2013 (including one (1) 1st rankers, two (2) 2nd rankers and two(2) 3rd rankers) . To sustain this consistent the excellent academic performance we honour the rank holders by awarding them Gold Medals on the Graduation Day. Class Toppers and Subject Toppers are also honoured with cash awards and appreciation certificates.
        
        As part of the process of enhancing the competitive spirit of the students, they are encouraged to actively participate in Inter-Collegiate competitions at national level. Quite a few prizes, including one for Android programming, have added laurels to our students. As further tools to arm the students to face the employment environment, various in-house as well as outsourced courses in Personality and Soft Skills Development, Business English Certificate courses and CCNA courses are conducted. We are also conducting certification courses like Microsoft Technical Associate (MTA) and Cloud Infrastructure and Systems (CIS).
        
        To enhance the employability of the students, the college supplements the in-house Soft Skills Training that is provided as part of the syllabus. This has improved our placement record. Leading IT companies and other reputed core companies organise placement drives at the college and hire students from our college. A representative list of prospective employers is being displayed on the home page of our website.
        
        From 2005, we are a part of the Campus Connect Program offered by Infosys – an organization that has offered placements to a large number of our graduates. In a recent statistical presentation Infosys have stated that 89.4% of the Saranathan students who joined them are in the top performance band out of which 54.2% fall under very high performance band.
        
        As part of our ongoing process of enlarging our Industry-Academia Interaction, our departmental HOD’s constantly work to enter into MOUs with corporate houses that lead to better opportunities for our students to get in-plant training, corporate project work possibilities, research programs and finally suitable placements in those reputed organisations.

        A well maintained playground for various outdoor games and excellent facilities for indoor games ensure that our students deliver consistent good performance in extra-curricular activities and thus bring justifiable laurels to the institution in various district, state and university level competitions.
